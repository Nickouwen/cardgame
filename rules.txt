There are 104 suitless cards.
Each card has a points value, ranging from 1-7. We will have to look up the points values of each card in the actual game, but I'm not sure it matters too much.
Each player is dealt 10 cards in their hand.
The dealer lays 4 cards face up on the table.
Players lay one card from their hand face down on the table.
Once all players have laid their cards, they flip them over at the same time.
The player with the lowest card # goes first. They place their card in a row next to the card with a lower number that is already on the table.
(The card is placed next to the closest number. So if the player plays a 32, and there is a 22 and a 31 on the table, you must play it on the 31 card.)
Once the sixth card in a row is played, the player picks up the entire row, leaving behind only the card they just played.
Once all ten cards are played, the points are totalled from the cards that have been picked up by each player. They are then added to the total score.
The game is played to 100 points.
